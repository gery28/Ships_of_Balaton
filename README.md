# Ships_of_Balaton
 
A little arcade game I made in pygame

The main goal is to shoot down the fish (currently just swordfish) and collect chests
You win when you collect all the chests, you lose when you run out of health
# Controls:
+ Movement: W,A,S,D
+ Cannon: Mouse1
+ Golden Circle: Q
+ Heal: R
+ Open chest: E
+ Pause: ESC

# Errors:
+ Sometimes the save switch gets clicked twice and doesn't switch
+ Sometimes the ship animation doesn't work when 2 buttons are pressed

# Windows Build
+ The executable may interfere with windows defender
+ Windows may flag it as a virus
